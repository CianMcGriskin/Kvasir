# Kvasir

This repository contains three final year projects as part of ATU year 2023/2024  year. As one team but required to seperate the project it was decided to split each project into a different branch.

The overall project was split into the following branches


## Kvasir Backend - Cian McGriskin
Live video streaming, cloud video saving, facial detection, recognition and notification backend service based on input images from previously captured video data.
